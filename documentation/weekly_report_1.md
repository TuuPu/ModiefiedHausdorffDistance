## Done this week:

I have mainly studied the details of Modified Hausdorff Distance equations and tried to understand how to implement it and its variation in my project. I also went through a great deal of examples of how to use MNIST database for object matching. This was done to understand the basic pieces of what I need to do. I found this benefitial, since it is my first experience in machine learning. I also enjoyed reading about the example since it seems that Modified Hausdorff Distance is not used that widely. The usual distance formula used in projects like these is the Euclidean distance. So this gives me an opportunity to understand what I need to do but I have to implement my solution on my own. I also feared that this might be too hard, since I have a fairly big imposter syndrome when it comes to math, but I've been pleasantly surprised about the fact that I seem to understand what I'm about to do.

## This week's process program-wise:

Virtual environment has been set up. I am using poetry. Dependencies installed are pytest and python 3.8 (and upwards) so far. Pylint for style checking also.

## What did I learn?

Different ways of calculating distances between objects that one would like to match. K-nearest neighbor algorithm's idea and simplicity (does not require many parameters to work) and overall the idea of how to manipulate input pictures as needed. For example using thresholds to convert a greyscale image to binary image using a threshold.

## What I need to still study?

How to actually compute a distance between a point to a set of points in Python. And also I think that I have theoretical understanding of what I need to do, but the practical implementation of the algorithm is going to give me some problems. But I welcome those problems with a smile, since it is the gist of the course.

## Next week:

Turning theoretical knowledge into practical skills. Probably going to build the data from a database and see that I can succesfully turn the greyscale images to binary images for further manipulation and distance calculating.
