## What have I done this week/How has the program progressed?

As for the program, I created a module where I can upload mnist-data from keras database and added methods for trimming down the training data to 10k pictures. The method also converts images from greyscale to binary images. The module has another method (for testing purposes so far) which prints the image chosen. I also created tests for the method that processes the dataset and converts the images. Did not write tests for the printing method since it's only a temporary function for this week to show my progression. I can say that easily the biggest chunk of my working time went to learning numpy and keras. I haven't done anything with either of those libraries and it took me a long time to understand how to use them efficiently, but I'm really glad of how everything turned out, even though it doesn't add up to many lines of code. I still think the foundation for the program is now set.

## What did I learn?

Well like I said previously, I think I learned alot about numpy and also how to manipulate images to a form where they can be observed in a neat way. I also learned a bit more about how to apply MHD in python, even though I didn't start working on it yet. But I think that understanding numpy better helps me move forward with MHD next week.

## What was left unclear?

Nothing really about this week, I think I understood what I did pretty well. MHD calculations are the upcoming problem and I think it will be a bit of a headache. I am not completely sure how to implement the calculations in python completely. I'm wondering if there are some matrix manipulation tricks that could be of use, when calculating the distance between a point and a set. So the thing that worries me is how to calculate d6 of the MHD in python. Also what gave me trouble was definitely configuration. I spent most of my saturday working with CI and Codecov. Ended up restructuring the whole project. But that's just everyday project problems.

## What's next?

Next week my aim is to build MHD calculations for the project, both D22 and D23 as was suggested. My plan was to actually do them this week already, or at least D22, but I had an exam on friday and it took alot of my time from the week. Also plan is to figure out a nicer way for comments in python other than writing them straight to the modules.
